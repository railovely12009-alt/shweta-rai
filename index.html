        <p>Dairy products or milk products are food products made from (or containing) milk.[1][a] The most common dairy animals are cow, water buffalo, nanny goat, and ewe. Dairy products include common grocery store food around the world such as yogurt, cheese, milk and butter.[4][5] A facility that produces dairy products is a dairy.[b][6] Dairy products are consumed worldwide to varying degrees.[7] Some people avoid some or all dairy products because of lactose intolerance, veganism, environmental concerns, other health reasons or beliefs.

Types of dairy product
Main article: List of dairy products
Milk

All dairy products derive from milk

Condensed milk
Milk is produced after optional homogenization or pasteurization, in several grades after standardization of the fat level, and possible addition of the bacteria Streptococcus lactis and Leuconostoc citrovorum. Milk can be broken down into several different categories based on type of product produced, including cream, butter, cheese, infant formula, and yogurt.

Milk varies in fat content. Skim milk is milk with zero fat, while whole milk products contain fat.

Milk is an ingredient in many confectioneries. Milk can be added to chocolate to produce milk chocolate.
<p>
Scalded milk
Condensed milk, milk which has been concentrated by evaporation, with sugar added for reduced process time and longer life in an opened can
Evaporated milk, (less concentrated than condensed) milk without added sugar
Baked milk is milk simmered on low heat for long time which results in mild caramelization. Particularly popular in Eastern Europe.
Dulce de leche
Malai
Powdered milk (or milk powder), produced by removing the water from (usually skim) milk
Khoa, milk which has been completely concentrated by evaporation, used in Indian cuisine
Infant formula, dried milk powder with specific additives for feeding human infants

Consumption patterns worldwide
Rates of dairy consumption vary widely worldwide. High-consumption countries consume more than 150 kilograms (330 lb) per capita per year. These countries are: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Costa Rica, most European countries, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Canada, the United States and Pakistan. Medium-consumption countries consume 30 kilograms (66 lb) to 150 kg per capita per year. These countries are: India, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Mongolia, New Zealand, North and Southern Africa, most of the Middle East, and most of Latin America and the Caribbean. Low-consumption countries consume under 30 kg per capita per year. These countries are: Senegal, most of Central Africa, and most of East and Southeast Asia.[7][8]

Lactose levels
For those with some degree of lactose intolerance, considering the amount of lactose in dairy products can be important to health.

Dairy product	Amount of lactose
Milk	Highest
Butter	Minimal (made from milk fat)
Hard cheese	Very low
Soft cheese	More than hard cheese
Intolerance and health research
Dairy products may upset the digestive system in individuals with lactose intolerance or a milk allergy.[9][10][11] People who experience lactose intolerance usually avoid milk and other lactose-containing dairy products, which may cause mild side effects, such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea.[9][10] Such individuals may use non-dairy milk substitutes. </p>
